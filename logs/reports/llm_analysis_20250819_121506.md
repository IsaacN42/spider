🕷️ Spider Intelligence Report

## 🏥 System Health Status
**GOOD**

Overall health assessment: The system appears to be functioning normally, with no critical issues detected.

## 🚨 Critical Issues
None identified at this time.

## ⚠️ Warnings
1. **High disk usage on remote server "zimaos"**: The root filesystem on the remote server is almost full (100% of 1.2G). This may cause issues with system stability and data availability if not addressed promptly.
2. **Running container with unknown status**: A single container named "crafty_container" is running, but its status is not explicitly shown in the provided snapshot.

## 📊 Key Metrics
* Total storage: 98G (used), with no high-usage filesystems detected locally.
* Docker containers: 1 total, 1 running.
* Listening services: 217.
* Remote servers: 1 connected to the system.

## 💡 Recommendations

**Immediate Fixes**

1. **Monitor and clean up remote server disk usage**: Regularly check the root filesystem on the remote server "zimaos" for high usage and take action to free up space if necessary (e.g., by deleting unnecessary files or upgrading storage).
2. **Verify container status**: Review the running containers and ensure that any unexpected or unknown-running containers are investigated and addressed.

**Long-term Optimization**

1. **Regularly review and optimize system configuration**: Schedule regular reviews of system settings, including network configurations, service management, and resource allocation.
2. **Implement disk space monitoring and alerts**: Set up automated monitoring for disk usage across all filesystems to prevent sudden spikes in usage and notify the admin team before issues arise.

## 🔮 Predictions
If current trends continue:

* The remote server "zimaos" may experience stability or data availability issues due to high disk usage.
* Unknown-running containers may lead to system instability, security vulnerabilities, or resource mismanagement if not properly addressed.
