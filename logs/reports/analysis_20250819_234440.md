🕷️ spider intelligence report

## 🏥 system health status
[overall health assessment: good]

## 🚨 critical issues
* None found.

## ⚠️ warnings
* The `/` partition is at 23% usage, which is above the recommended threshold for a data partition. This may indicate that the system is running low on disk space.
* There are 217 listening services, which is significantly higher than expected. This could be a sign of unnecessary or security-vulnerable services.

## 📊 key metrics
* Total filesystems count: 9
* High usage partitions: None (but note the warning above)
* Total usage:
	+ `/run`: 1% used (6.9M/1.6G)
	+ `/sys/firmware/efi/efivars`: 9% used (11K/128K)
	+ `/`: 23% used (22G/98G)
	+ `/dev/shm`: 0% used
	+ `/run/lock`: 0% used

## 💡 recommendations
* Monitor the `/` partition usage closely and consider adding more storage or optimizing data placement.
* Investigate and disable unnecessary services to reduce the number of listening services (217).
* Review containerized applications (casaos) to ensure they are secure, up-to-date, and properly configured.

## 🔮 predictions
If current trends continue:
* The `/` partition may reach 100% usage, causing system crashes or data loss.
* The high number of listening services may increase the attack surface, making the system more vulnerable to security threats.
