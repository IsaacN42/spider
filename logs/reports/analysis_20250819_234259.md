🕷️ Spider Intelligence Report

## 🏥 System Health Status
Overall health assessment: Good

## 🚨 Critical Issues
None

## ⚠️ Warnings
* `/`: 23% usage is relatively high for a root partition, but given the ZimaOS architecture knowledge that it's normal and expected behavior, this is more of a monitoring point than an immediate concern.
* `listening_services`: 217 listening services on the system might indicate potential security risks or performance issues if not properly configured.

## 📊 Key Metrics
* `/data` partition health: No data available in the snapshot to assess its health.
* Total containers: 1 running container (`crafty_container`) which is expected and normal for ZimaOS with CasaOS managing containerized applications.
* Network interfaces scanned: True, indicating that network scanning has been performed.

## 💡 Recommendations
1. **Monitor `/` partition usage**: Keep a close eye on the root partition's usage (currently at 23%) to ensure it doesn't exceed capacity and impact system performance or stability.
2. **Review listening services**: Investigate and configure the 217 listening services to minimize security risks and optimize system performance.
3. **Assess `/data` partition health**: Ensure that the main data storage on `/data` is healthy and not showing any signs of degradation, as this would be a critical issue.

## 🔮 Predictions
If current trends continue:
- The root partition (`/`) usage might reach its capacity limit, leading to system instability or even crashes.
- Unconfigured or unnecessary listening services could pose security risks if left unaddressed.

By following these recommendations and keeping a close eye on the system's health, you can prevent potential issues and ensure your ZimaOS server remains stable and secure.
